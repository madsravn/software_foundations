  Exercise: 3 stars, advanced (alternate)
  Complete the definition of alternate, which "zips up" two lists into one, alternating between elements taken from the first list and elements from the second. See the tests below for more specific examples.

  Note: one natural and elegant way of writing alternate will fail to satisfy Coq's requirement that all Fixpoint definitions be "obviously terminating." If you find yourself in this rut, look for a slightly more verbose solution that considers elements of both lists at the same time. (One possible solution requires defining a new kind of pairs, but this is not the only way.)

Example test_count2: count 6 [1,2,3,1,4,1] = 0.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed. 

(* Multiset sum is similar to set union: sum a b contains all the elements of a and of b. (Mathematicians usually define union on multisets a little bit differently, which is why we don't use that name for this operation.) For sum we're giving you a header that does not give explicit names to the arguments. Moreover, it uses the keyword Definition instead of Fixpoint, so even if you had names for the arguments, you wouldn't be able to process them recursively. The point of stating the question this way is to encourage you to think about whether sum can be implemented in another way â€” perhaps by using functions that have already been defined. *)
