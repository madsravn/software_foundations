(**
  Could this proof also be carried out by induction on n instead of E? If not, why not?
**)

(**
  No - if we use induction on n, we end up having to consider ev (S n). We cannot determine whether S n is even or odd from the form given and have no further evidence for it. Furthermore, we have no mechanism for pulling out the S from ev (S n), and so we cannot apply the inductive hypothesis in any way.

Exercise: 4 stars, advanced (subsequence)
A list is a subsequence of another list if all of the elements in the first list occur in the same order in the second list, possibly with some extra elements in between. For example,
    [1,2,3]
is a subsequence of each of the lists
    [1,2,3]
    [1,1,1,2,2,3]
    [1,2,7,3]
    [5,6,1,9,9,2,7,3,8]
but it is not a subsequence of any of the lists
    [1,2]
    [1,3]
    [5,6,2,1,7,3,8]
Define an inductive proposition subseq on list nat that captures what it means to be a subsequence. (Hint: You'll need three cases.)
Prove that subsequence is reflexive, that is, any list is a subsequence of itself.
Prove that for any lists l1, l2, and l3, if l1 is a subsequence of l2, then l1 is also a subsequence of l2 ++ l3.
(Optional, harder) Prove that subsequence is transitive â€” that is, if l1 is a subsequence of l2 and l2 is a subsequence of l3, then l1 is a subsequence of l3. Hint: choose your induction carefully!
