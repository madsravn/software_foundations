Exercise: 2 stars (blt_nat)
The blt_nat function tests natural numbers for less-than, yielding a boolean. Instead of making up a new Fixpoint for this one, define it in terms of a previously defined function.
Note: If you have trouble with the simpl tactic, try using compute, which is like simpl on steroids. However, there is a simple, elegant solution for which simpl suffices.

(**************************************************
  Exercise: 4 stars, recommended (binary)
  Consider a different, more efficient representation of natural numbers using a binary rather than unary system. That is, instead of saying that each natural number is either zero or the successor of a natural number, we can say that each binary number is either

    zero,
    twice a binary number, or
    one more than twice a binary number.

(a) First, write an inductive definition of the type bin corresponding to this 
description of binary numbers.
(Hint: recall that the definition of nat from class,
    Inductive nat : Type :=
      | O : nat
      | S : nat â†’ nat.
says nothing about what O and S "mean". It just says "O is a nat (whatever that is), and if n is a nat then so is S n". The interpretation of O as zero and S as 
successor/plus one comes from the way that we use nat values, by writing functions to do things with them, proving things about them, and so on. Your definition of bin should be correspondingly simple; it is the functions you will write next that will give it mathematical meaning.) *)

Inductive bin : Type :=
| inf : bin
| zero : bin -> bin
| one : bin -> bin.

(* (b) Next, write an increment function for binary numbers, and a function to convert binary numbers to unary numbers. *)

Fixpoint incbin (n : bin) : bin :=
match n with
| inf => one inf
| zero nn => one nn
| one nn => zero (incbin nn)
end.

Example incbin_test : incbin (one (one inf)) = zero (zero (one inf)).
Proof. reflexivity. Qed. 
  
Definition incnat (n : nat) : nat := S n.

Fixpoint bin_to_un (n : bin) : nat :=
match n with
| inf => O
| zero nn => mult 2 (bin_to_un nn)
| one nn => plus 1 (mult 2 (bin_to_un nn))
end.

Example test_bin_un1 : bin_to_un (zero (one (zero (one inf)))) = 10.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

Fixpoint un_to_bin (n : nat) : bin :=
match n with
| O => inf
| S nn => incbin (un_to_bin nn) 
end.

Example test_bin_un2 : un_to_bin 14 = zero (one (one (one inf))).
Proof. simpl. reflexivity. Qed. 

(* (c) Finally, prove that your increment and binary-to-unary functions commute: that is, incrementing a binary number and then converting it to unary yields the same result as first converting it to unary and then incrementing. *)

Theorem inc_un_comm : forall (m : bin),
                        bin_to_un (incbin m) = incnat (bin_to_un m).
Proof. 
  intro m. induction m as [|m1 |m2].

  assert (H : S (bin_to_un m2) + bin_to_un m2 = bin_to_un m2 + S (bin_to_un m2)). 
   apply plus_comm. 
  rewrite -> H. rewrite <- plus_n_Sm. reflexivity. 
Qed. 



(**************************************************
  Exercise: 2 stars, optional (decreasing) 
  The requirement that some argument to each function be "decreasing" is a fundamental feature of Coq's design: In particular, it guarantees that every function that can be defined in Coq will terminate on all inputs. However, because Coq's "decreasing analysis" is not very sophisticated, it is sometimes necessary to write functions in slightly unnatural ways. To get a concrete sense of this, find a way to write a sensible Fixpoint definition (of a simple function on numbers, say) that does terminate on all inputs, but that Coq will not accept because of this restriction. 
**************************************************)

Fixpoint plus2 (n : nat) (m : nat) : nat :=
match (m, n) with 
| (O, O) => O
| (O, S(nn)) => nn
| (S(mm), O) => mm
| (S(mm), S(nn)) => S (S (plus nn mm))
end.

Example test_plus2 : (plus2 2 3) = 5.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity. Qed.
Eval simpl in (plus2 10 5).

(* Fixpoint plus3 (n : nat) (m : nat) : nat :=
match n with 
| O => m
| nn => plus3 (pred nn) (S m)
end. *)
